# Investigating Medical Patient's No-Show Appointments
## By Divya Nitin Naidu

## Overview
The goal of this project is to investigate a dataset of appoinment records for Brasil public hospitals. The data includes some attributes of patients and state if the patients showed up to appointments. The analysis is focused on finding trends influencing patients to show or not show up to appointments.

This project was completed as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree certification.

## Questions investigated:

What characteristics leads to more no show appointments?

Whether the provisions provided by the scheduling office influence the patients show ups?

How has trend been between no shows and show ups?

What would be the suggested measures to improve the no show rates?

## Conclusions

Finding ways to improve performance is critical in the plight to provide greater access to care. Optimizing scheduling systems has been identified as one system level approach to address access needs. For example, reducing the number of missed appointments is crucial as when appointment slots go unused it effectively reduces access to others in need of an appointment.

After investigating the dataset, I can conclude that factors such as age, gender, wait time, days of week, and various health reasons have effect on the show rates. One of the most shocking revelation was more people with SMS reminders not showing up for the appointment. But again, as the data provided is for a noticeably short time frame, we can't forecast the same for future. I did not do any analysis with respect to neighborhood as the hospital address was not provided, so there was no point of distance comparison. But logistics can be one of the factors that affect the show rate.

As this was only an exploratory analysis most of the potential factors remain undiscovered.
